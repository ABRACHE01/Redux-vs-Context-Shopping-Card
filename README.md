# Redux Branch (Using Redux and Redux Toolkit)

This branch is maintained by Issam and contains the implementation of the shopping cart project using Redux for state management, as well as Redux Toolkit for a streamlined development experience.

## Overview

In this branch, we utilize Redux for state management in the shopping cart project. **Redux** is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It provides a centralized store to manage the entire state of your application and ensures that state changes are handled in a predictable and organized manner. You can find more information about Redux [here](https://redux.js.org/).

In addition to Redux, we also leverage **Redux Toolkit**, which is a package that simplifies the usage of Redux and makes it more efficient. Redux Toolkit includes utilities for common Redux tasks, such as creating slices, reducers, and actions. It promotes a more ergonomic development experience by reducing boilerplate code. For more details about Redux Toolkit, visit the official documentation [here](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).
