# Redux-vs-Context-Shopping-Cart

This is a collaborative shopping cart project that explores the use of state management with two different approaches: Redux and Context API. In this project, two separate branches have been created to showcase the implementations of Redux and Context API, with each branch being maintained by one of the collaborators.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to compare the usage and benefits of Redux and the Context API for state management in a React application. By collaborating with a classmate, we have created separate branches for Redux and Context API implementations, allowing for a side-by-side comparison of these two popular state management solutions.

## Collaborators

- MEZGUELDI Issam ([MEZ901](https://github.com/MEZ901))
- ABRACHE Mohamed ([medabra](https://github.com/medabra))

## Branches

### Redux Branch

The Redux branch is maintained by Issam and contains the implementation of the shopping cart using Redux for state management. You can find detailed information and usage instructions in the [Redux branch README](https://github.com/MEZ901/Redux-vs-Context-Shopping-Cart/tree/redux#readme).

### ContextAPI Branch

The ContextAPI branch is maintained by Mohamed and contains the implementation of the shopping cart using the Context API for state management. You can find detailed information and usage instructions in the [ContextAPI branch README](https://github.com/MEZ901/Redux-vs-Context-Shopping-Cart/tree/context-api#readme).
