# ContextAPI Branch

This branch is maintained by Mohamed and contains the implementation of the shopping cart project using the Context API for state management.

## Overview
In this branch, we utilize the Context API for state management in the shopping cart project. The Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. You can find more information about the Context API [here](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
